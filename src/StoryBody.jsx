                    <p>
                        The year is 2022 and Artificial Intelligence is taking over the planet! The computational nature of A.I has built 
                        a bad reputation that has people on earth convinced that it (A.I) could be a potential threat. Little do people 
                        realize that we humans program A.I with command prompt and what we humans program A.I to do or not do 
                        is all A.I seems to be capable of. This could be up for debate, either way this is why we need you to be a 
                        ChainKid as we enter this new realm of intelligence. One thing I believe we can agree upon though is that the 
                        beauty of A.I is that it has the ability to connect us, organize and synchronize us. A.I actually has the 
                        ability to bring humanity together and benefit humanity through the use of smart contracts and tokenization.
                        As we head to a new world that will also eventually eliminate our old identities, we have to make a way to
                        deliver new identities using blockchain technology. At first this may sound foreign to most and that is why a group 
                        of humans were needed to explain exactly why this is happening, where we are going and exactly how we can prepare
                        to utilize and monetize this new world.

                        Welcome the ChainKids, a group of young tech savvy geniuses. These web3 enthusiasts have decided to get 5000
                        other web3 enthusiasts together to spread the potential that lies in web3 and blockchain technology.
                        With a utopian society in mind these kids understand the connection that web3 will bring and have made it
                        their mission to onboard as many people as possible, as early as possible. The ChaiKids will also search the 
                        web with the intent to help those re-identify into the new world, the metaverse. Once these kids reach the masses
                        they can then reset society and implement this utopia, a new decentralized mindset free from the oppressive powers that
                        be. Come join the blockchain adventure today and let's connect. Together let's learn what one another may know and spread 
                        web3 awareness. The only enemy is yourself, the only enemy is your mind and your lack of awareness. Web3 is about 
                        the combination of selves and utilization of communities, this is why we will build that community, Web3 and 
                        blockchain is the future, you are the future and together we will innovate and create the future. Through tokenization
                        and the utilization of smart contracts we are entering an era of infinite possibility. The final part of the project 
                        which will be explained in the second whitepaper is operation Keychain. Refer to the VOID in the links on 
                        the main screen for now, Operation Keychain is where even more power lies. Keychain is where THE POWER lies.
                        As the ChainKids grow it is essential you pay attention. Lastly I will leave you with one final gem...
                        KEEP your $CODE, enjoy.
